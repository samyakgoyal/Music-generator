# Music-generator ðŸŽ¶

In this model I have taken the dataset of Irish folk songs (in ABC notation) from MITdeepLearning and using the concepts of RNN and LSTM generated new music .
You can generate new music every time you want which would never had been listened before!!
The new music will be generated as ABC notation in the tmp.abc file which you can use to convert into mp3.
You can use the website (to convert the ABC notation to mp3 and listen to it): http://www.mandolintab.net/abcconverter.php
